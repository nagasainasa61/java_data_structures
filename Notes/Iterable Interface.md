#Iterable Interface



* Each collection has an iterator object to traverse the elements
* It provides the tools for walking through a data structure
* It hides the details of how data is stored
* The collection Interface extends the Interable interface



* Methods in the iterable interface are iterator(), foreach().
* The iterator() method returns an iterator object.
* The iterator includes hasNext(), next() and remove().
* The iterable interface is used to traverse the elements.



* In addition to the iterable interface, there is a ListIterator.
* The ListIterator is used for list data structures
* This adds functionality to traverse the list backward
* Methods include previous(), hasPrevious(), previousIndex().
