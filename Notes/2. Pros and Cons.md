**Advantages of ArrayList and Vector**

* Provide fast access using indexing
* Memory Coherence
* Provide an Initial size 
* Use internal arrays for storage, which makes random access fast

**Disadvantages of ArrayList and Vector**
* Can be time consuming to add elements in the middle
* Waste space if array is not full
* Need to be resized when they reach capacity
* Slower when deleting the elements from middle

**Advantages of LinkedList**
* Insertion and deletion operations are easily implemented
* Elements are efficiently added or deleted from the middle of the list

**Disadvantages of LinkedList**
* Elements in a linked list must be read sequentially
* Elements are not stored sequentially in memory.
* Random access to elements can be inefficient
* Slower iterations and extra memory overhead are required.
