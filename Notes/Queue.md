#Queue

* A linear list is where items are added to one end and deleted from the other end.
* Examples include waiting in line at a sporting event.
* People join the queue at the end and exit from the front.
* Another example is a print queue.
* `add()` - used to add elements to the end.
* `peek()` - returns a copy of the first element.
* `remove()` - removes from the top; error if empty.
* `poll()` - removes from the top; returns null if the queue is empty.
