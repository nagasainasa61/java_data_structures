#Stack

* A stack uses a last in, first out order.
* It is a vertical stack of objects.
* The last element added is the first to come off.
* Items are added and deleted from the same end.
* To add an item, you use the `push()` method.
* To remove an item, you use `pop()`
* The `peek()` method makes a copy of the first Item.
* A Stack is an easy way to reverse a collection of values.
