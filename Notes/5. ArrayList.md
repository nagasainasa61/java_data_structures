#ArrayList

* An ArrayList can hold null values.
* It is not inherently thread safe.
* Quick access is provided to elements based in index position.
* Developers can add or remove elements by index value.
* Easily find the index of first occurrence of an element.
* The initial size capacity can be set when created.
* The `trimTo()` method can reduce the size.
